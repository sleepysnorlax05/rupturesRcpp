# 8 Examples and case studies

``` r
library(rupturesRcpp)
```

This chapter collects longer examples. The two simulated examples below
use `binSeg`: a change in mean and variance (`"SIGMA"` cost), and a
change in autoregressive dynamics (`"VAR"` cost). The second example
also shows how to change an existing object through its active bindings.

## Simulated examples

### 2-regime SIGMA example via binary segmentation

To demonstrate the package usage, we first consider a simple 2d time
series with two piecewise Gaussian regimes and varying variance.

``` r
set.seed(1)
tsMat = cbind(c(rnorm(100,0), rnorm(100,5,5)),
              c(rnorm(100,0), rnorm(100,5,5)))
```

As our example involves regimes with varying variance, a suitable
`costFunc` option is `"SIGMA"`. Since the segmentation objects’
interfaces are similar, it is sufficient to demonstrate the usage of
`binSeg` only.

``` r
SIGMAObj = costFunc$new("SIGMA", addSmallDiag = TRUE, epsilon = 1e-6)
binSegObj = binSeg$new(minSize = 1L, jump = 1L, costFunc = SIGMAObj)
binSegObj$fit(tsMat)
```

Once fitted, `$predict()` and `$eval()` can be used. To view the
configurations of the `binSeg` object, we can use `$describe()`.

``` r
binSegObj$describe(printConfig = TRUE)
#> Binary Segmentation (binSeg) 
#> minSize      : 1L
#> jump         : 1L
#> costFunc     : "SIGMA"
#> addSmallDiag : TRUE
#> epsilon      : 1e-06
#> fitted       : TRUE
#> n            : 200L
#> p            : 2L
```

To obtain an estimated segmentation, we can use the `$predict()` method
and specify a non-negative penalty value `pen`, which should be properly
tuned. This returns a sorted integer vector of end-points, including the
number of observations by design.

Here, we set `pen = 100`.

``` r
binSegObj$predict(pen = 100)
#> [1] 100 200
```

After running `$predict()`, the segmentation output is temporarily saved
to the `binSeg` object, allowing users to use the `$plot()` method
without specifying `endPts`.

``` r
binSegObj$plot(d = 1:2,
               main = "method: binSeg; costFunc: SIGMA; pen: 100")
```

### 2-regime VAR example: Modifying a `binSeg` object through its active bindings

You can also modify a `binSeg` object’s fields through its active
bindings. To demonstrate this, we consider a piecewise vector
autoregressive example with constant noise variance.

``` r
set.seed(1)
tsMat = matrix(c(filter(rnorm(100), filter = 0.9, method = "recursive"),
                 filter(rnorm(100), filter = -0.9, method = "recursive")))
```

Here, the most suitable cost function is `"VAR"`. Instead of creating a
new `binSeg` object, we will modify the current `binSegObj` as follows:

``` r
VARObj = costFunc$new("VAR")
binSegObj$tsMat = tsMat
binSegObj$costFunc = VARObj
#> `costFunc` has been updated. Re-fitting the model.
#> Warning in private$.binSegModule$fit(): Some systems seem singular! Switch to
#> the approximate arma::solve()!
```

Modifying `tsMat` (or any other bindings) will automatically trigger
`self$fit()` if a `tsMat` has already existed.

``` r
binSegObj$describe(printConfig = TRUE)
#> Binary Segmentation (binSeg) 
#> minSize      : 1L
#> jump         : 1L
#> costFunc     : "VAR"
#> pVAR         : 1L
#> fitted       : TRUE
#> n            : 200L
#> p            : 1L
```

We can then perform binary segmentation with `pen = 25` and plot the
segmentation results.

``` r
binSegObj$predict(pen = 25)
#> [1]  99 200
binSegObj$plot(d = 1L,
               main = "method: binSeg; costFunc: VAR; pen: 25")
```

lines.](examples_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

The warning is expected: with `minSize = 1L`, some candidate segments
have too few observations to fit the VAR model, so their cost falls back
to an approximate solve.

## Case studies

Case studies on real data are to be added.

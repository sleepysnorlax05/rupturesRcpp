# Exact Dynamic Programming (`Dynp`)

An `R6` class implementing exact dynamic programming for offline
change-point detection.

## Details

`Dynp` finds the segmentation that globally minimises the total cost for
a *specified* number of change-points – unlike `PELT` (exact for a
penalty, not a change-point count) and `binSeg` (greedy at each split,
not guaranteed globally optimal for a fixed count), `Dynp` is exact for
whatever `nBkps` is requested. The price is complexity: building the
full table costs \\O(\text{nBkpsMax} \cdot M^2)\\ where \\M\\ is the
number of `(minSize, jump)`-admissible grid points (\\M \approx
n/\text{jump}\\ in the worst case), versus PELT's near-linear pruning or
binSeg's \\O(n \log n)\\-ish greedy search. `$fit()` computes the exact
minimal cost for *every* change-point count from `0` to `nBkpsMax` in
one pass (see `$costPath()`). `Dynp` is therefore useful when an exact
fixed-number-of-change-points solution is required, particularly when
using custom cost functions for which PELT pruning cannot be guaranteed.

`Dynp` requires a `R6` object of class `costFunc`, exactly as
`PELT`/`binSeg`/`Window` do – see `costFunc` for the supported cost
functions (`"L1"`, `"L2"`, `"SIGMA"`, `"VAR"`, `"LinearL2"`,
`"LinearSIGMA"`, `"LinearL1"`, `"Custom"`).

Some examples are provided below. See the [package

## Active bindings

- `minSize`:

  Integer. Minimum allowed segment length. Can be accessed or modified
  via `$minSize`. Modifying `minSize` will automatically trigger
  `$fit()`.

- `jump`:

  Integer. Search grid step size. Can be accessed or modified via
  `$jump`. Modifying `jump` will automatically trigger `$fit()`.

- `nBkpsMax`:

  Integer or `NULL`. Upper bound on the number of change-points the
  exact DP table is built for; `$predict(nBkps = ...)` treats this as a
  cap, not a requirement – see `$predict()`. If `NULL` (default),
  `$fit()` resolves it to `min(20, floor(n / minSize) - 1)`, i.e. the
  maximum feasible value given `minSize`, capped at 20. Set explicitly
  to go beyond 20 (up to the maximum feasible value) or to lower it; the
  table costs \\O(\text{nBkpsMax} \cdot M^2)\\ work and
  \\O(\text{nBkpsMax} \cdot M)\\ memory. Can be accessed or modified via
  `$nBkpsMax`; modifying it will automatically trigger `$fit()`.

- `costFunc`:

  `R6` object of class `costFunc`. Can be accessed or modified via
  `$costFunc`. Modifying `costFunc` will automatically trigger `$fit()`.

- `tsMat`:

  Numeric matrix. Input time series matrix of size \\n \times p\\. Can
  be accessed or modified via `$tsMat`. Modifying `tsMat` will
  automatically trigger `$fit()`.

- `covariates`:

  Numeric matrix. Input time series matrix having a similar number of
  observations as `tsMat`. Can be accessed or modified via
  `$covariates`. Modifying `covariates` will automatically trigger
  `$fit()`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `new()`

Initialises a `Dynp` object.

#### Usage

    Dynp$new(minSize, jump, nBkpsMax, costFunc)

#### Arguments

- `minSize`:

  Integer. Minimum allowed segment length. Default: `1L`.

- `jump`:

  Integer. Search grid step size: only positions in {k, 2k, ...} are
  considered. Default: `1L`.

- `nBkpsMax`:

  Integer or `NULL`. Upper bound on the number of change-points to build
  the exact DP table for. Default: `NULL` (resolved to
  `min(20, floor(n / minSize) - 1)` at `$fit()` time).

- `costFunc`:

  A `R6` object of class `costFunc`. Should be created via
  `costFunc$new()` to avoid error. Default: `costFunc$new("L2")`.

#### Returns

Invisibly returns `NULL`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `describe()`

Describes a `Dynp` object.

#### Usage

    Dynp$describe(printConfig = FALSE)

#### Arguments

- `printConfig`:

  Logical. Whether to print object configurations. Default: `FALSE`.

#### Returns

Invisibly returns a list storing at least the following fields:

- `minSize`:

  Minimum allowed segment length.

- `jump`:

  Search grid step size.

- `nBkpsMax`:

  The user-set `nBkpsMax` (possibly `NULL`).

- `resolvedNBkpsMax`:

  The `nBkpsMax` actually used by the last `$fit()` (`NULL` if not
  fitted).

- `costFunc`:

  The `costFunc` object.

- `fitted`:

  Whether or not `$fit()` has been run.

- `tsMat`:

  Time series matrix.

- `covariates`:

  Covariate matrix (if exists).

- `n`:

  Number of observations.

- `p`:

  Number of features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `fit()`

Constructs a `C++` module for `Dynp` and builds the exact DP table.

#### Usage

    Dynp$fit(tsMat = NULL, covariates = NULL)

#### Arguments

- `tsMat`:

  Numeric matrix. A time series matrix of size \\n \times p\\ whose rows
  are observations ordered in time. If `tsMat = NULL`, the method will
  use the previously assigned `tsMat` (e.g., set via the active binding
  `$tsMat` or from a prior `$fit(tsMat)`). Default: `NULL`.

- `covariates`:

  Numeric matrix. A time series matrix having a similar number of
  observations as `tsMat`. Required for models involving both dependent
  and independent variables. If `covariates = NULL` and no prior
  covariates were set (i.e., `$covariates` is still `NULL`), the model
  is force-fitted with only an intercept. Default: `NULL`.

#### Details

This method constructs a `C++` `Dynp` module and sets `private$.fitted`
to `TRUE`, enabling the use of `$predict()`, `$costPath()` and
`$eval()`. If `$nBkpsMax` is `NULL`, it is resolved here to
`min(20, floor(n / minSize) - 1)` (with a message); if set higher than
`floor(n / minSize) - 1`, it is capped to that (with a warning).

#### Returns

Invisibly returns `NULL`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`eval()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/eval.html)

Evaluate the cost of the segment (a,b\]

#### Usage

    Dynp$eval(a, b)

#### Arguments

- `a`:

  Integer. Start index of the segment (exclusive). Must satisfy
  `start < end`.

- `b`:

  Integer. End index of the segment (inclusive).

#### Returns

The segment cost. See `costFunc` for the cost formulas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html)

Returns the exact optimal breakpoints, either under a linear penalty or
for a specified number of change-points.

#### Usage

    Dynp$predict(pen = 0, nBkps = NULL)

#### Arguments

- `pen`:

  Numeric. Penalty per change-point; the change-point count is chosen by
  minimising \\\text{cost} + \text{pen} \cdot k\\ over \\k = 0, \dots,
  \text{nBkpsMax}\\ (same convention as `PELT`/`binSeg`/`Window`).
  Ignored if `nBkps` is supplied. Default: `0`.

- `nBkps`:

  Integer. If supplied, takes precedence over `pen`: returns the exact
  optimal segmentation for exactly `nBkps` change-points. Treated as an
  upper bound, not a strict requirement, in the same spirit as
  `binSeg`/`Window`: if `nBkps` exceeds `nBkpsMax`, it is capped to
  `nBkpsMax` and a message reports the shortfall. Unlike
  `binSeg`/`Window`, the result is still exact for whatever count is
  actually used – capping only ever happens because the DP table wasn't
  built that far (a configuration choice via `$nBkpsMax`), not because
  `Dynp` ran out of candidates the way a greedy search can. If no valid
  segmentation exists at all for the (possibly capped) count – only
  possible when `jump` is large relative to `minSize` – this still
  errors, since there is no well-defined
  smaller-but-still-what-you-asked-for answer to fall back to. Default:
  `NULL`.

#### Details

With `nBkps = k`, this returns the segmentation into exactly `k`
change-points that globally minimises the total cost – exact, unlike
`binSeg$predict()` for the same `k`. With `pen`, this instead minimises
the penalised cost over every change-point count the DP table covers,
matching how `PELT`/`binSeg`/`Window` already select a count from a
penalty.

Both the DP table (via `$fit()`) and the traceback here only depend on
`minSize`/`jump` admissible positions, so `$predict()` itself is cheap
(`O(nBkps)`) regardless of which mode is used – the cost was already
paid in `$fit()`.

Temporary segment end-points are saved to `private$.tmpEndPoints` after
`$predict()`, enabling users to call `$plot()` without specifying
endpoints manually.

#### Returns

An integer vector of regime end-points. By design, the last element is
the number of observations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`segments()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/segments.html)

Returns the cost and parameter estimates of each segment from the latest
`$predict()`.

#### Usage

    Dynp$segments()

#### Details

Let \\0 = c_0 \< c_1 \< \dots \< c\_{k+1} = n\\ be the end-points from
the latest `$predict()`. Segment \\i\\ is \\(c\_{i-1}, c_i\]\\, `Cost`
is \\c\_{(c\_{i-1}, c_i\]}\\ and `Params` is its minimiser. The costs
sum to `$costPath()[k + 1]`, the exact minimal total cost for \\k\\
change-points. With `nBkps`, \\k\\ is the requested count (capped at the
resolved `nBkpsMax`). With `pen`, \\k\\ is the count, from 0 up to the
resolved `nBkpsMax`, that minimises the total cost plus `pen` times
\\k\\.

Temporary end-points are cleared by `$fit()`, so `$predict()` must be
run again after modifying the object via its active bindings.

#### Returns

A list with one element per segment \\(Start, End\]\\. Each element is a
list with:

- `Start`:

  Start index of the segment (exclusive, 0-based), same convention as
  `$eval()`.

- `End`:

  End index of the segment (inclusive).

- `Cost`:

  The segment cost, as returned by `$eval(Start, End)`.

- `Params`:

  A named list of the segment parameter estimates, e.g.
  `list(mean = ...)` for `"L2"`. See `costFactory` for the fields
  returned by each cost function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `costPath()`

Returns the exact minimal cost for every change-point count the DP table
covers.

#### Usage

    Dynp$costPath()

#### Details

This is the data behind the "elbow method" for choosing the number of
change-points: plot it (see `$getHistory()`/`$plotElbow()`) and look for
where the marginal decrease in cost flattens out. It comes for free out
of `$fit()` – no extra computation is triggered here.

#### Returns

A numeric vector of length `resolvedNBkpsMax + 1`: element `k+1` is the
exact minimal total cost of segmenting the series into exactly `k`
change-points, for `k = 0, ..., resolvedNBkpsMax`. `Inf` at position
`k+1` means no valid segmentation with exactly `k` change-points exists
given `minSize`/`jump` (only possible when `jump` is large relative to
`minSize`).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `getHistory()`

Retrieves the exact minimal cost for every change-point count the DP
table covers, as a `data.frame` (same shape as `binSeg`/`Window`'s
`$getHistory()`, minus `added_bkp`).

#### Usage

    Dynp$getHistory()

#### Details

Unlike `binSeg`/`Window`, there is no `added_bkp` column here: `binSeg`
and `Window` each build a single *nested* sequence of change-points,
where every `k`'s answer is the previous `k-1`'s answer plus one more
point, so "the breakpoint added at this step" is well-defined. `Dynp`'s
per-`k` solutions are each independently exact and need not be nested at
all – the optimal segmentation for `k` change-points can differ
completely from the one for `k-1`. Use `$predict(nBkps = k)` to get the
full breakpoint set for a given `k`.

#### Returns

A `data.frame` with two columns:

- `k`:

  The number of change-points, from `0` to the resolved `nBkpsMax`.

- `cost`:

  The exact minimal total cost of segmenting the series into exactly `k`
  change-points (see `$costPath()`).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `plotElbow()`

Plots the elbow curve (Total Cost vs. Number of Change-Points).

#### Usage

    Dynp$plotElbow(maxK = NULL)

#### Arguments

- `maxK`:

  Integer. The maximum number of change-points to display on the plot.
  If `NULL`, displays the full history. Default: `NULL`.

#### Returns

A `ggplot` object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)

Plots change-point segmentation

#### Usage

    Dynp$plot(
      d = 1L,
      endPts,
      dimNames,
      main,
      xlab,
      tsWidth = 0.25,
      tsCol = "#5B9BD5",
      bgCol = c("#A3C4F3", "#FBB1BD"),
      bgAlpha = 0.5,
      ncol = 1L
    )

#### Arguments

- `d`:

  Integer vector. Dimensions to plot. Default: `1L`.

- `endPts`:

  Integer vector. End points. Default: latest temporary changepoints
  obtained via `$predict()`.

- `dimNames`:

  Character vector. Feature names matching length of `d`. Defaults to
  `"X1", "X2", ...`.

- `main`:

  Character. Main title. Defaults to `"Dynp: d = ..."`.

- `xlab`:

  Character. X-axis label. Default: `"Time"`.

- `tsWidth`:

  Numeric. Line width for time series and segments. Default: `0.25`.

- `tsCol`:

  Character. Time series color. Default: `"#5B9BD5"`.

- `bgCol`:

  Character vector. Segment colors, recycled to length of `endPts`.
  Default: `c("#A3C4F3", "#FBB1BD")`.

- `bgAlpha`:

  Numeric. Background transparency. Default: `0.5`.

- `ncol`:

  Integer. Number of columns in facet layout. Default: `1L`.

#### Details

plots can easily be horizontally and vertically stacked using
`patchwork`'s operators `/` and `|`, respectively.

#### Returns

An object of classes `gg` and `ggplot`.

# Slicing Window (`Window`)

An `R6` class implementing slicing window for offline change-point
detection.

## Details

Slicing window is a scalable, linear-time change-point detection
algorithm that selects breakpoints based on local gains computed over
sliding windows.

Currently supports the following cost functions:

- `"L1"` and `"L2"` for (independent) piecewise Gaussian process with
  **constant variance**

- `"SIGMA"`: for (independent) piecewise Gaussian process with **varying
  variance**

- `"VAR"`: for piecewise Gaussian vector-regressive process with
  **constant noise variance**

- `"LinearL2"`: for piecewise linear regression process with **constant
  noise variance**

- `"LinearSIGMA"`: for piecewise linear regression process with
  **varying noise covariance**

- `"LinearL1"`: for piecewise linear regression process under **L1
  (least absolute deviations) loss**

`Window` requires a `R6` object of class `costFunc`, which can be
created via `costFunc$new()`. Currently, the following cost functions
are supported:

- `"L1"` and `"L2"` for (independent) piecewise Gaussian process with
  **constant variance**

- `"SIGMA"`: for (independent) piecewise Gaussian process with **varying
  variance**

- `"VAR"`: for piecewise Gaussian vector-regressive process with
  **constant noise variance**

- `"LinearL2"`: for piecewise linear regression process with **constant
  noise variance**

- `"LinearSIGMA"`: for piecewise linear regression process with
  **varying noise covariance**

- `"LinearL1"`: for piecewise linear regression process under **L1
  (least absolute deviations) loss**

See `$eval()` method for more details on computation of cost.

### Method `new()`

Initialises a `Window` object.

#### Usage

    Window$new(minSize, jump, radius, costFunc)

#### Arguments

- `minSize`:

  Integer. Minimum allowed segment length. Default: `1L`.

- `jump`:

  Integer. Search grid step size: only positions in {k, 2k, ...} are
  considered. Default: `1L`.

- `radius`:

  Integer. Radius of each sliding window. Default: `1L`.

- `costFunc`:

  A `R6` object of class `costFunc`. Should be created via
  `costFunc$new()` to avoid error. Default: `costFunc$new("L2")`.

#### Returns

Invisibly returns `NULL`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `describe()`

Describes a `Window` object.

#### Usage

    Window$describe(printConfig = FALSE)

#### Arguments

- `printConfig`:

  Logical. Whether to print object configurations. Default: `FALSE`.

#### Returns

Invisibly returns a list storing at least the following fields:

- `minSize`:

  Minimum allowed segment length.

- `jump`:

  Search grid step size.

- `radius`:

  Radius of each sliding window.

- `costFunc`:

  The `costFunc` object.

- `fitted`:

  Whether or not `$fit()` has been run.

- `tsMat`:

  Time series matrix.

- `covariates`:

  Covariate matrix (if exists).

- `n`:

  Number of observations.

- `p`:

  Number of features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `fit()`

Constructs a `C++` module for `Window`.

#### Usage

    Window$fit(tsMat = NULL, covariates = NULL)

#### Arguments

- `tsMat`:

  Numeric matrix. A time series matrix of size \\n \times p\\ whose rows
  are observations ordered in time. If `tsMat = NULL`, the method will
  use the previously assigned `tsMat` (e.g., set via the active binding
  `$tsMat` or from a prior `$fit(tsMat)`). Default: `NULL`.

- `covariates`:

  Numeric matrix. A time series matrix having a similar number of
  observations as `tsMat`. Required for models involving both dependent
  and independent variables. If `covariates = NULL` and no prior
  covariates were set (i.e., `$covariates` is still `NULL`), the model
  is force-fitted with only an intercept. Default: `NULL`..

#### Details

This method constructs a `C++` `Window` module and sets
`private$.fitted` to `TRUE`, enabling the use of `$predict()` and
`$eval()`. Some precomputations are performed to allow `$predict()` to
run in linear time with respect to the number of local change-points
(see `$predict()` for more details).

#### Returns

Invisibly returns `NULL`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`eval()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/eval.html)

Evaluate the cost of the segment (a,b\]

#### Usage

    Window$eval(a, b)

#### Arguments

- `a`:

  Integer. Start index of the segment (exclusive). Must satisfy
  `start < end`.

- `b`:

  Integer. End index of the segment (inclusive).

#### Details

The segment cost is evaluated as follows:

- **L1 cost function**: \$\$c\_{L_1}(y\_{(a+1)...b}) := \sum\_{t =
  a+1}^{b} \\ y_t - \tilde{y}\_{(a+1)...b} \\\_1\$\$ where
  \\\tilde{y}\_{(a+1)...b}\\ is the coordinate-wise median of the
  segment. If \\a \ge b - 1\\, return 0.

- **L2 cost function**: \$\$c\_{L_2}(y\_{(a+1)...b}) := \sum\_{t =
  a+1}^{b} \\ y_t - \bar{y}\_{(a+1)...b} \\\_2^2\$\$ where
  \\\bar{y}\_{(a+1)...b}\\ is the empirical mean of the segment. If \\a
  \ge b - 1\\, return 0.

- **SIGMA cost function**: \$\$c\_{\sum}(y\_{(a+1)...b}) := (b - a)\log
  \det \hat{\Sigma}\_{(a+1)...b}\$\$ where \\\hat{\Sigma}\_{(a+1)...b}\\
  is the empirical covariance matrix of the segment without Bessel's
  correction. Here, if `addSmallDiag = TRUE`, a small bias `epsilon` is
  added to the diagonal of estimated covariance matrices to improve
  numerical stability.  
    
  By default, `addSmallDiag = TRUE` and `epsilon = 1e-6`. In case
  `addSmallDiag = TRUE`, if the computed determinant of covariance
  matrix is either 0 (singular) or smaller than `p*log(epsilon)` - the
  lower bound, return `(b - a)*p*log(epsilon)`, otherwise, output an
  error message.

- **VAR(r) cost function**: \$\$c\_{\mathrm{VAR}}(y\_{(a+1)...b}) :=
  \sum\_{t = a+r+1}^{b} \left\\ y_t - \sum\_{j=1}^r \hat A_j y\_{t-j}
  \right\\\_2^2\$\$ where \\\hat A_j\\ are the estimated VAR
  coefficients, commonly estimated via the OLS criterion. If system is
  singular, \\a-b \< p\*r+1\\ (i.e., not enough observations), or \\a
  \ge n-p\\ (where `n` is the time series length), return 0.

- **"LinearL2"** for piecewise linear regression process with **constant
  noise variance** \$\$c\_{\text{LinearL2}}(y\_{(a+1):b}) :=
  \sum\_{t=a+1}^b \\ y_t - X_t \hat{\beta} \\\_2^2\$\$ where
  \\\hat{\beta}\\ are OLS estimates on segment \\(a+1):b\\. If segment
  is shorter than the minimum number of points needed for OLS, return 0.

- **"LinearSIGMA"** for piecewise linear regression process with
  **varying noise covariance** \$\$c\_{\text{LinearSIGMA}}(y\_{(a+1):b})
  := (b-a)\log \det \hat\Sigma\_{(a+1):b}\$\$ where
  \\\hat\Sigma\_{(a+1):b}\\ is the empirical covariance matrix of OLS
  residuals \\y - X\hat{\beta}\\ on segment \\(a+1):b\\, estimated the
  same way as in the SIGMA cost function.

- **"LinearL1"** for piecewise linear regression process under **L1
  (least absolute deviations) loss**
  \$\$c\_{\text{LinearL1}}(y\_{(a+1):b}) := \sum\_{t=a+1}^b \\ y_t - X_t
  \hat{\beta} \\\_1\$\$ where \\\hat{\beta}\\ is fit column-by-column
  via IRLS on segment \\(a+1):b\\, iterated until convergence (`tol`) or
  `maxIter`. Unlike the other regression costs, this has no
  \\O(1)\\-per-segment closed form.

#### Returns

The segment cost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html)

Performs `Window` given a linear penalty value, or a target number of
change-points.

#### Usage

    Window$predict(pen = 0, nBkps = NULL)

#### Arguments

- `pen`:

  Numeric. Penalty per change-point. Ignored if `nBkps` is supplied.
  Default: `0`.

- `nBkps`:

  Integer. If supplied, takes precedence over `pen`: returns the `nBkps`
  highest-gain local maxima found by `$fit()` (see `$getHistory()`),
  i.e. `Window`'s own best answer for that many change-points – not
  necessarily the globally optimal one for that count (see `Dynp` for
  that guarantee). Treated as an upper bound, not a strict requirement:
  `Window` only ever finds finitely many local maxima, so if fewer than
  `nBkps` exist, all of them are returned and a message reports the
  shortfall. Default: `NULL`.

#### Details

The algorithm scans the data with a fixed-size window to detect
candidate local change-points (lcps) if the gains of its
\\k\_\text{thresh}\\ neighbors to the left and right are all smaller
than its gain, where \\k\_\text{thresh}\\ is defined as \$\$
k\_\text{thresh} = \max \left( \frac{\max(2\text{radius}, 2 \cdot
\text{minSize})}{2 \cdot \text{jump}}, 1 \right) \$\$

After candidate local change-points and computing the local gains, the
algorithm selects the "optimal" set of break-points given the linear
penalty threshold. Let \\G_i\\ denote the local gain for candidate
change-point \\i\\, for \\i = 1, \dots, n\_\text{lcps}\\. The local
gains are ordered such that \\G_1 \ge G_2 \ge \dots \ge
G\_{n\_\text{lcps}}\\. Note that it is possible that no local
change-points are detected, for example if the window size is too large.

The total cost for the selected \\k\\ change-points is then calculated
as \$\$ \text{TotalCost} = - \sum\_{i=1}^{k} G_i + \lambda \cdot k, \$\$
where \\\lambda\\ is a linear penalty applied per change-point. We then
optimise over \\k\\ to minimise the penalised cost function.

This approach allows detecting multiple change-points in a time series
while controlling model complexity through the linear penalty threshold.

In our implementation, scanning the data to detect candidate local
change-points and computing their corresponding local gains is already
performed in `$fit()`. Therefore, `$predict()` runs in linear time with
respect to the number of local change-points.

Temporary segment end-points are saved to `private$.tmpEndPoints` after
`$predict()`, enabling users to call `$plot()` without specifying
endpoints manually.

#### Returns

An integer vector of regime end-points. By design, the last element is
the number of observations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`segments()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/segments.html)

Returns the cost and parameter estimates of each segment from the latest
`$predict()`.

#### Usage

    Window$segments()

#### Details

Let \\0 = c_0 \< c_1 \< \dots \< c\_{k+1} = n\\ be the end-points from
the latest `$predict()`, called with either `pen` or `nBkps`. Segment
\\i\\ is \\(c\_{i-1}, c_i\]\\, `Cost` is \\c\_{(c\_{i-1}, c_i\]}\\ and
`Params` is its minimiser. The costs sum to the total cost of this
segmentation. For \\k \ge 1\\ this generally differs from
`$getHistory()$cost[k + 1]`, which subtracts local gains computed on
windows of `2 * radius` points instead of re-evaluating the segments.

Temporary end-points are cleared by `$fit()`, so `$predict()` must be
run again after modifying the object via its active bindings.

#### Returns

A list with one element per segment \\(Start, End\]\\. Each element is a
list with:

- `Start`:

  Start index of the segment (exclusive, 0-based), same convention as
  `$eval()`.

- `End`:

  End index of the segment (inclusive).

- `Cost`:

  The segment cost, as returned by `$eval(Start, End)`.

- `Params`:

  A named list of the segment parameter estimates, e.g.
  `list(mean = ...)` for `"L2"`. See `costFactory` for the fields
  returned by each cost function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `getHistory()`

Retrieves the full cost history and sequentially added breakpoints.

#### Usage

    Window$getHistory()

#### Returns

A `data.frame` with three columns:

- `k`:

  The number of change-points.

- `cost`:

  The total unpenalised cost of the segmentation.

- `added_bkp`:

  The breakpoint added at this step to achieve the cost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method `plotElbow()`

Plots the elbow curve (Total Cost vs. Number of Change-Points).

#### Usage

    Window$plotElbow(maxK = NULL)

#### Arguments

- `maxK`:

  Integer. The maximum number of change-points to display on the plot.
  If `NULL`, displays the full history. Default: `NULL`.

#### Returns

A `ggplot` object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)

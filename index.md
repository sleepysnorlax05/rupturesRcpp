`rupturesRcpp` is an R package for **high-performance offline
change-point detection in multivariate time series**. It provides a
unified, object-oriented R6 interface to change-point detection methods
implemented efficiently in C++.

The package detects **changes in the underlying structure of a time
series**, including changes in mean, covariance, autoregressive
dynamics, and regression relationships with covariates. It supports a
range of cost functions, and segmentation algorithms, from fast
heuristic methods to exact dynamic-programming and penalised
optimisation methods.

## Supported Methods

### Cost Functions

| Cost function | Detects changes in |
|----|----|
| `"L1"`, `"L2"` | Mean structure; `"L1"` provides greater robustness to outliers |
| `"SIGMA"` | Mean and covariance structure |
| `"VAR"` | Vector autoregressive dynamics |
| `"LinearL2"`, `"LinearL1"` | Linear regression relationships with covariates; `"LinearL1"` provides greater robustness to outliers |
| `"LinearSIGMA"` | Regression relationships and residual covariance |
| `"Custom"` | User-defined structural changes through an R cost function |

### Segmentation Methods

| Method   | Search strategy                                             |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `binSeg` | Binary segmentation; a fast greedy search                   |
| `Window` | Sliding-window search based on local changes                |
| `PELT`   | Penalised optimisation with pruning                         |
| `Dynp`   | Dynamic programming for a specified number of change-points |

## About the Project

`rupturesRcpp` provides an R implementation of functionality inspired by
the Python library
[ruptures](https://centre-borelli.github.io/ruptures-docs/), with a
focus on efficient C++ implementations and an R-native object-oriented
interface.

The package was developed during **Google Summer of Code 2025** for [The
R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) by
[@edelweiss611428](https://github.com/edelweiss611428), under the
mentorship of [@tdhock](https://github.com/tdhock) and
[@deepcharles](https://github.com/deepcharles). The original GSoC
project archive is available on the [gsoc-2025
branch](https://github.com/edelweiss611428/rupturesRcpp/blob/gsoc-2025/README.md).

## Installation

``` r

# Development version, documented on the package website
install.packages("rupturesRcpp",
                 repos = c("https://edelweiss611428.r-universe.dev",
                           "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

# CRAN release (1.0.3)
install.packages("rupturesRcpp")
```

Documentation and case studies are available on the [package
website](https://edelweiss611428.github.io/rupturesRcpp/). See [Getting
started](https://edelweiss611428.github.io/rupturesRcpp/articles/getting-started.html)
for the differences between the two versions and a first detection.
